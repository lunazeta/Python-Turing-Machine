both pygame.quit and pygame.event.get must be called from the main thread
therefore
have the main thread run the graphics
but then start a new thread to run the turing machine

ACTUALLY

i could just run the turing machine first
record everything. (i.e. current index, state, tape)
and then feed that into the graphics display that will run everything

1. make it so the turing machine runs first
2. make sure the TapeDisplay processes the data correctly
3. add smoothing? - too lazy, maybe do later
4. profit
